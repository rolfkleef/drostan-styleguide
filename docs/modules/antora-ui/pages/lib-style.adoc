= Style library

== Introduction

The styleguide repository contains an Antora component that can be included as a _library_ in a documentation site.
This component does not define any pages, but contains files in the other _content families_:
images, snippets, examples, and so on.

[NOTE]
====
The Antora UI for drostan is adapted to not include the library when building the site components menu.

This effectively makes it a _hidden_ component.
====

== Adding the style library to a site

The easiest way is to add the styleguide repository as git submodule to the repository containing the Antora playbook.

  $ git submodule add https://gitlab.com/rolfkleef/drostan-styleguide.git styleguide

[TIP]
====
Adding the styleguide as submodule will also make other style elements available:

- A PlantUML configuration file that can be inserted in each diagram, to create consistent styling.
- Vale style libraries to check writing style.
- CSL definitions to use in Zotero bibliography exports.
====

In the playbook, add the library component as start path like below:

[source, yaml]
----
# ...

content:
  sources:
  - url: .
    branches: main
    start_paths:
    - docs/component1
    - docs/component2
    - styleguide/lib/antora

# ...
----

== Including elements from the library

Use standard Antora references to include elements:

.Include a partial
====
[source, asciidoc]
----
\include::lib-style::partial$example.adoc[]
----

include::lib-style::partial$example.adoc[]
====

.Include an image
====
[source, asciidoc]
----
image::lib-style::slide-haidagwaii.png[]
----

image::lib-style::slide-haidagwaii.png[]
