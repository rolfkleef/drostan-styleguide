= Antora UI

This section contains additional documentation for the drostan.org version of the UI.

== Adapting the Antora default UI

. Create a fork of https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default[the Antora Default UI repository^].
. Specify the appropriate branches and repository specified under `bundle-stable` and `bundle-dev` to let Gitlab build a bundle for the UI.
. Use the URL of your fork in the Antora playbook.
+
.Example for my version: repository under `rolfkleef`, branch `drostan`
[source, yaml]
....
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/rolfkleef/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/drostan/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
  supplemental_files: antora-supplemental-ui
....

Once a new version of the UI is built, instruct Antora to get the new version with the `--fetch` command line parameter.

Use the supplemental files to override a selection of files in the bundle.

[NOTE]
====
The CSS files are processed and packed in the bundle.
You can only override it as a whole.
====

The Handlebars templates are present as sources in the bundle.
It is possible to override an HBS template by including a new one via the `supplemental_files` folder.

.Add a specific brand link via `nav-brand.hbs`
[source, html]
....
include::example$nav-brand.hbs[]
....

.Add the links to sections of documentation via `nav-sections.hbs`
[source, html]
