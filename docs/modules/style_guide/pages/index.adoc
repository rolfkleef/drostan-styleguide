= Visual style

The visual style of my notes site is a combination of a few elements:

* The main interface tries to integrate with the Material Design 3 theme I use for my Wordpress site.

* The navigation of components, versions, and pages, mixes Antora's approach into this interface.

* The textual content of pages is built from Asciidoc with their approach to generating HTML.

* Diagrams can be included in various formats.
** Diagrams made with PlantUML have their own style.
** Mermaid diagrams are not styled yet.
** Directory layouts are rendered with Treeview, with particular icons.

This reference section shows all of the visual elements.

I also use this section to check style or interface updates I make.
